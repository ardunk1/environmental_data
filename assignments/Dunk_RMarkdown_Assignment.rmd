# Introduction
My name is **Adrienne Dunk** and I am in my second year of the *Environmental Conservation - Watershed and Wetlands Management* Professional Master's degree program. I am currently a Project Manager and Wetland Scientist for a local Environmental Consulting firm. I hope to gain additional scientific insight into current research and the science of watersheds, stream ecology, and restoration science while obtaining this degree. Upon completing the degree, I intend to continue working as a consultant.
